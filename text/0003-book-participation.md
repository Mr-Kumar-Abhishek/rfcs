# Participation in writing the book

This RFC aims to lay out how participating in authoring the book works.

## Details

I would like for the book to not be solely written by myself. That said, when
I started this project, I wasn’t sure if anyone would even want to help out,
and I had a plan. Including others means that plan may change.

Specifically, here is my proposal:

* There are two groups of contributors to the book: editors and authors.
* All editors are authors, but not all authors are editors.
* Editors have a commit bit, authors must send in PRs.
* The editorial board can change over time.

### Authors

Anyone may be an author of the book. Authors:

* Tweak and modify the text of the book.
* Collaborate with editors to produce rough drafts of new chapters.

There’s two kinds of contributions, book-wise, and these two responsibilities
are reflected in these two points. There’s editing existing text, and creating
new text. These two cases are slightly different:

#### Tweak and modify

The book will need a _lot_ of refinement over time. Authors will be a big hand
in this. Submitting improvments to our existing text is really, really helpful.

These changes will go through the PR process and will be accepted by editors.

#### New Chapters

Until we have a complete first draft of the book, there will need to be initial
drafts for chapters. Having someone contribute these would be great! However,
they need to fit in with the overall book. It’s hard to keep consistent tone
amongst a group of authors, though. As such, editors will have to help out
authors a lot to make sure that the book is coherent overall.

There are two forms of coherence: the tone and style of the text itself, and a
chapter fitting into the overal vision of the work. New chapters need to be on
the kind of material we need and want. The text of the chapter needs to be
similar to the other chapters.

As such, an author that wishes to write a new chapter should check with the
editors by opening an issue about it, so that they don’t do a lot of work that
may end up rejected. Furthermore, the editors may ask for significant revisions
of the draft before it’s merged to make everything consistent overall.

### Editors

Editors are primarily responsible for the overall quality of the book.

The editorial team should work to produce an table of contents, so that authors
can contribute chapters. If problems arise with the initial table of contents,
editors should work together to revise it to solve these problems.

Editors will review pull requests from authors and make sure that they’re of
a high enough quality before merging.

Editors are also authors. When acting as an author, they must still act in
accordance with those roles: they should still submit content through the pull
request process. Editorship is about being able to sign off on changes, not
just push whatever changes you want.

#### Editorial team

The initial editorial team will be:

* Steve Klabnik
* Ryan Levick

The team may add and remove editors at their discretion. Adding a member
requires consensus, and removing a member requires consensus amongst all of the
editors other than the individual being removed.

## Drawbacks

Working with multiple authors in a distributed fashion is a lot more work.
This drawback is mitigated by increased quality.

## Alternatives

I could say “I’m the sole author of the book, sorry.” That would certainly
simplify some things. However, that means that this is more of a personal
project of mine, and less of a community one, and I would like to culitivate a
community around intermezzOS. I also think it would lead to a significantly
worse book.
