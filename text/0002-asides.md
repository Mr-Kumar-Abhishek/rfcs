# Asides

IntermezzOS the book will visually separate asides from the rest of the text.

## Details

Extra tidbits of information, "fun facts", or little asides are great for increasing
the reader's attention and engagement. Some information is useful only as context or
is just plain fun to learn about even if not 100% relevant.

The book already includes many asides inline which can make finding more "important
information" harder and may prevent some readers (especially those who are
reading a section for second or third time) from finding relevant information.

Therefore, asides should be visually separated from the rest of the text and
marked as asides.

## Drawbacks

Asides are a great way to "slow things down" when things are getting harder to
understand. Without them, other devices will need to be used to keep the right pace.

Also, writers must always remember to appropriately format the text they are
writing.

## Alternatives

Two alternatives: keep as is or remove all asides.

### Keep as is

Asides are not a "problem" per say, but the advantages of keeping them separate
outweigh the disadvantages.

### Remove all asides

How boring!
